‚ÄúI had a lot of fun with Hack Club. In just the day that I worked, I learned the basics of making a website and I really loved working with y‚Äôall. This helped me on how I want to open people‚Äôs eyes on global warming.‚Äù¬† ‚Äî Addie, a 7th grader from San Antonio

Lonestar was an 8-hour all-female/nonbinary hackathon from September 15th-17th! As a sister-event to Horizon, Alpine, and Spark, Lonestar was held between Hack Club and Girl Scouts of Southwest Texas with 30 participants and organizers, inspiring middle and high-schoolers to write their first lines of code ‚ú® On September 16th, we held two workshops: Intro to Web-Dev and Hardware w/Tinkercad. At the end of the day, we celebrated our day of learning with an awards ceremony, where every scout left with a prize of their own: a confidence to pursue STEM in their futures.

A rundown we accomplished throughout the weekend:

## üéØ The Goal
We came into this weekend with 2 goals:
1. To support Hack Clubbers to become more technical, to become better leaders, and to deepen friendships through collaborative coding projects.
2. To grow Hack Club‚Äôs community so it is inclusive and accessible to teenagers of all backgrounds. We made active outreach to under-represented, less-advantaged young people, including girls and girls of color, who don‚Äôt have computer science programs or professional mentors in their community.
